# KBDatalakeDashboard

This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).

Dashboard viewer for KBase genome datalake tables. This module generates interactive HTML reports from `KBaseFBA.GenomeDataLakeTables` objects, providing a configurable data table renderer for exploring genome datalake data directly within KBase Narratives.

You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).

You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/KBDatalakeDashboard) or its [spec file](KBDatalakeDashboard.spec).
